"""Stop WinZapp's Node server on quit, as the Windows build does.

_stop_wpp_server() ends with `taskkill /F /T` on Windows. Off Windows it
only proc.terminate()s — which Node ignores while start.js shuts down —
and when this run reused a server a previous run left behind, it finds that
server through a netstat lookup that is Windows-only, so nothing is killed
at all and Node lingers after Quit.

Mac equivalents: find the listener with lsof, and after upstream's own
shutdown (which has already flushed and released the WhatsApp profile)
make sure that process and its children are gone.
